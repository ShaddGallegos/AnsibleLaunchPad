# Ansible EDA and ServiceNow
 While ServiceNow excels as a comprehensive IT Service Management (ITSM) and workflow automation platform, there are specific scenarios where Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) offers advantages, particularly for real-time, automated responses to events at the infrastructure or application level. 

Here are some use cases where EDA might be preferred over relying solely on ServiceNow's workflow capabilities:
- Real-time Infrastructure Remediation: When a critical server experiences high CPU usage, EDA can automatically detect the event and trigger an Ansible Playbook to restart the service or perform other immediate remediation actions, ensuring minimal downtime and human intervention.
- Proactive Security Patching: Upon detecting a new security vulnerability, EDA can automatically trigger a patch deployment playbook to vulnerable systems, reducing the window of exposure and ensuring faster mitigation compared to a manual, ticket-driven process in ServiceNow.
- Dynamic Resource Provisioning: In environments with fluctuating demands, such as handling traffic spikes, EDA can monitor resource utilization and automatically provision additional resources (like scaling applications in OpenShift) without manual intervention, ensuring applications remain responsive and available.
- Automated Configuration Updates based on Policy Changes: When policy updates occur, EDA can automatically roll out configuration changes across the infrastructure, ensuring consistency and compliance without the need for manual tracking and application of updates.
- Integrating with Observability Tools for Automated Actions: EDA can process events generated by various observability tools (like monitoring solutions or even custom webhooks) and automatically execute corresponding Ansible playbooks to diagnose issues, gather facts, or perform remediation tasks.
- Self-Healing Capabilities: For scenarios where a service goes down or a specific process fails, EDA can detect the event and automatically trigger an Ansible playbook to restart the service, reconfigure components, or failover to a backup system, enabling self-healing capabilities within the IT infrastructure. 

 EDA excels when the need is for rapid, automated responses triggered by events in the IT environment, whereas ServiceNow provides a robust platform for managing IT services, tracking requests, and orchestrating broader workflows that may involve human interaction and approvals alongside automation.

 EDA and ServiceNow are not mutually exclusive. They can be integrated to leverage the strengths of both platforms. For example, EDA can be used to automatically remediate incidents, and then integrate with ServiceNow to update incident tickets, enriching them with details about the actions taken and their results. This provides a closed-loop automation system, where events trigger actions, and the outcomes are fed back into ServiceNow for tracking and service management purposes
